With Galaxy, we found all the tools we needed to create these workflows. We also found the flexibility to add or update any tool we need, same for databases. Galaxy also has the power to return the results along with the visualisations and reports all in one place (history). So users of our Galaxy created workflows, will not only be able to run the workflows easily and get the results directly, but also can adapt the workflows to any other type of sequencing technique or any other analysis and that is because Galaxy allows users to easily do that. Furthermore, using Galaxy bot, the whole process of analysing and tracking pathogens within samples can be automated, to run and return results directly after a new sample is uploaded. Galaxy’s bulk processing and computational power allows users to run the workflows with collections of huge datasets.	Health & Disease
