Lack of experience	Galaxy Australia, usegalaxy.org.au	Unsure how to utilise different 16s databases such as Midas	Unsure	I have previously outsourced my 16s and MAG analysis to an external provider. However, I have noted inaccuracies in organism identification. This is why I am trying to learn so I can re-process my raw-data. Although I am struggling at the moment with the examples and workflows as they are not completely similar to my case. It's not completely intuitive for people new to bioinformatics. I would be great if suggestions provided for differences in workflow. Perhaps providing a simple single 16s forward and reverse read rather than multiple datasets to start with and what to do if you want to use a different taxonomic database.   I will continue to progress my understanding as I believe it is important area in our field to have an understanding of.	General training materials on Galaxy site and YouTube Galaxy page.
